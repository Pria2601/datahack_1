# datahack_1

here i used logistic regression . 
before this i tried random forest classifier and some other models but data set is pretty large, so they didnt worked out.
then i used logistic regresion but it still did not worked due to large size.
then i sorted the data and used it again.
it didnt worked due to multi value result.
then i used multi output classifier model.
finally...
this time it worked:)

PCA was not working on my kernel in vir envirnment for some absurd reason .. which i am yet to debug..

although result is not exceptionally good.(roc_auc = 0.57)
but it is more than random guessing ;)
i didnt get enough time as i was engaged somewhere else..
other things which can be done are Naive bayes and lightgbm.
this dataset has specific categories to catBoost can be used too.would be slow though
